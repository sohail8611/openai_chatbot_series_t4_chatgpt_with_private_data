2023 interesting science events:

1 February
C/2022 E3 (ZTF), a green-coloured comet from the Oort cloud, is observed in the night sky making its closest approach to Earth.[154]
An article examines Leonardo da Vinci's experiments on gravity in the Codex Arundel and presents a solution using Newtonian mechanics to confirm Leonardo's "equivalence principle".[155]
3 February – Researchers show how pre-installed apps on Android smartphones in China are used for mass surveillance in China.[156][157]
6 February
Astronomers announce the discovery of an additional 12 moons of Jupiter.[158]
A previously unknown cell mechanism involved in aging is discovered, which explains how cells 'remember' their identity when they divide – the cells' so-called epigenetic memory.[159][additional citation(s) needed]
A study integrates policy as an aspect into an integrated assessment model, showing that Powering Past Coal Alliance-based (from COP23) coal phase-out is highly unlikely (<5%) with current policies where both coal-use would substantially only shift from power to other industries (steel, cement, and chemicals) and China now potentially "dangerously delay[ing]" the phase-out.[160][161]
7 February
A study quantifies and maps threats of glacial lake outburst floods caused by climate change, finding ~15 million people to be at risk.[162][163]
A UN report projects there could be 10 million annual deaths from antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) superbugs by 2050 if steps aren't taken and highlights driving factors like climate change and economic sectors' activities, suggesting a One Health-type approach.[164][165] (See also 19 Jan 2022 for current rates.) An analysis of global antibiotics use in livestock – which is one of the known drivers of AMR in livestock and wildlife/environment and also impacts human health[166][167][168] – shows that it has declined in Europe and China (plateaued) due to new policy but increased globally (1 Feb).[169][170] Around 1 February, news report on 'super pigs' – invasive hybrids resulting from cross-breeding domestic pigs with wild boars, that are relatively intelligent, adaptable and resilient and by that time cause major economic- and environmental damage across North America as well as human health risks[171][172] – previously described as the "most prolific invasive mammals on Earth".[173]
News outlets report on a study (21 Nov 2022) demonstrating locust antennae implanted as biosensors into (bio-hybrid) robots for AI-interpreted machine olfaction.[174][175]

9 February: Safety-by-design ways like DNA screening for biosafety and biosecurity to prevent engineered pandemics

9 February: Results of the first longevity caloric restriction (CR) trial, CALERIE

15 February: Cosmologists report results that suggest black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy.
8 February
The minor planet Quaoar is found to have a ring system, following observations by the CHEOPS space telescope.[176][177]
Scientists in the U.S. propose mining the lunar soil and launching it towards the Sun to form a shield (space sunshade) against global warming.[178][179]
The first direct transfer of qubits between quantum computer microchips is demonstrated, with a 99.999993% accuracy rate and connection speed of 2424/s. The research team suggests their work has "the potential to scale-up by connecting hundreds or even thousands of quantum computing microchips."[180][181]
Two studies show how the microbiome can drive and interact with chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).[182][183][184]
3D printing-like additive 3D assembly of matter using holographic sound fields is demonstrated, with early fields of applications including rapid biofabrication/TE, having several advantages over a similar method using light reported in 2017.[185][186]
